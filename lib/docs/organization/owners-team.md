## Owners team

The **owners** team is responsible for the apps, people, teams and access management of an organization.

This team can't be removed and be empty as well. Meaning there is always some one who can manage an organization. The team also always have `admin` access to any application that belongs to an organization.

A user from the **owners** team can always be used as an API user on an app.
That makes it also important for those users to remain a GitHub or BitBucket account connected to wercker.
