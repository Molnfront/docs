## Application access

An application that belongs to an organization only accepts teams as collaborators and always have the **owners** team setup as **admin** collaborator.

A **team** can have the same permissions as a single collaborator, that permissions are `build + view deploys`, `build + deployment` and `admin`. [Read more about permissons &rsaquo;](/docs/web-interface/roles-and-permissions.html)

Giving a team `admin` access means they are allowed to do the same management on an application as the **owners** team. Meaning they can also change the permission on a team or delete the applications.
