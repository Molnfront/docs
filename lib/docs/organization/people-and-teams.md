## People and Teams

To start managing your organization you will first need to start adding people.

When you're part of the **owners** team on an organization you're allowed to access the settings page. You can reach that page via the organziations profile page. The manage buttons on that page will only be visible for team members on the **owners** team.

### People

Here you can add users to be part of your organization.

> You can only add users who are signed up for wercker

Once you added a user you have the option to set them to `public` or `private`, this enables you to hide certain people of your organization from the public profile page.

Now that you have added some people you can start adding them to a team.

### Teams

Here you can create and manage teams of your organization.
