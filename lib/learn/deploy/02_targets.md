## Targets

To be able to deploy you need three things:

* An account and an application on wercker
* A green build for that application
* A deploy target.

To deploy code, a deploy target needs to be created.
Various deploy targets exist on wercker; Heroku, OpenShift, Custom and
the wercker directory.

With the Heroku deploy target you are able to deploy your code to the Heroku
platform-as-a-service and with the Custom target you can deploy to your own
servers, such as Amazon, RackSpace and Digital Ocean.
