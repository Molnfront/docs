## Introduction to the wercker.yml

The `wercker.yml` file allows you to set up your [automation
pipelines](/learn/pipelines/01_introduction.html). YAML is a readable
and friendly markup language. 

The `wercker.yml` file is a configuration
file in the YAML format that specify how your build and deploy pipelines
should be run and which [steps](/learn/steps/01_introduction.html)
should be executed in those pipelines.

As your `werkcer.yml` configuration is under source control its contents
can vary per git commit.

> the contents of your wercker.yml can be different per commit

In the next sections we will go over the syntax and sections of the
`wercker.yml`, how you can program it using environment variables and
finally a showing a complete working example.
