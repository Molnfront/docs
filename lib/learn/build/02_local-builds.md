## Local builds

Besides running builds on the wercker platform you can run builds
locally as well. See the [wercker CLI section](/learn/basics/03_the-wercker-cli.html) for more information of
setting up your local wercker environment.

### Using the CLI to run a local build

From within your project folder run the following command.

```sh
wercker build
```

In the next section we'll look at how to pull builds into your local
environment.
