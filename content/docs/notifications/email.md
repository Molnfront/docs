## Email notifications

Wercker has built-in support for email notifications. This means you
do not have to define a custom [after-step](/docs/steps/after-steps.html) to get
emails on failing or passing builds/deploys.

Built-in email notifications are systemwide however, and therefore cannot be
used on application-level.
