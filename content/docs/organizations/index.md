## Organizations

Through organizations you can create and organize teams to make access management
on applications way easier and more efficient.

You can start to create a new 'Organization' from the create dropdown or
from your profile settings page.

As you can see you can choose between two options on how to create a new organization.

### Create

Creating a new organization only requires you to fill in an organization name and
contact email address. This email address is also used to create your organizations
avatar with [Gravatar](https://gravatar.com/).

### Convert

With convert you can use the username that you are logged in with, to
convert your user to
new organization with the name of the current logged in user..

> Please note that converting a user to an organization is a permanent action.

Fill in a contact email address. This email address will also be used to
create your organization's
avatar with [Gravatar](https://gravatar.com/).

#### Pick a new username

Because your current username will be used as the organization's name, you will
need to enter a new username for the current user with which you can login.

Once you have completed converting your user, you will be logged out and in,
in order to finalise the process.

### Finished

When you have created your organization, a new **owners** team is added
as the first team. The **owners** team is responsible for the applications,
people, teams, and access management of an organization.
