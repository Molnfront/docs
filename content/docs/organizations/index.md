## Organizations

Through organizations you can create and organize teams to make access management
on applications way easier and more efficient.

You can start to create a new 'Organization' from the create dropdown or
from your profile settings page.

As you can see you can choose between two options on how to create a new organization.

### Create

Creating a new organization only requires you to fill in an organization name and
contact email address. This email address is also used to create your organizations
avatar with [Gravatar](https://gravatar.com/).

### Convert

With convert you can use the username that you are logged in with, to name your
new organization.

> Please note that converting is a perminent action.

Fill in a contact email address. This email address is also used to create your organizations
avatar with [Gravatar](https://gravatar.com/).

#### Pick a new username

Because your current username will be used as the organization's name, you will
need to enter a new username for the current user with which you can login.

Once you have completed converting your username, you will be logged out and in,
in order to finalise the process.

### Finished

When you have created your organization a new **owners** team is added with you
as the first team member. The **owners** team is responsible for the applications,
people, teams, and access management of an organization.
