## What IP addresses does wercker use that you can whitelist

These IP addresses only apply for classic wercker builds and deploys.

* 54.84.120.252
* 54.84.97.93
* 54.84.78.203
* 54.84.0.100
* 54.86.208.46
* 54.88.153.254
* 54.84.63.197
* 54.164.4.93
* 54.85.254.37
* 54.210.27.137
* 54.165.210.200
* 52.0.121.246
* 54.86.61.205
* 52.4.3.172

The docker enabled stack does not have static IP's at the moment. This means
that IP addresses may change without notice. That said, there is
[a GitHub issue](https://github.com/wercker/support/issues/47) that does
contain the IP addresses currently in use and will be kept up-to-date.
