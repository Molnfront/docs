### Getting started with wercker
This guide is a step-by-step approach to developing, building and deploying a
sample app with wercker within minutes.

While this guide uses Python, the general concepts apply to every other
programming language.

This guide assumes you have a working Docker environment, if not please see
[this guide](http://devcenter.wercker.com/docs/cli/requirements.html) and it
also assumes you have a free [wercker
account](https:/https://app.wercker.com/users/new/).

The first step in this tutorial is [installing the
CLI](http://devcenter.wercker.com/docs/getting-started/setting_up_cli.html).
If you already have the CLI installed, feel free to skip to [step
2](http://devcenter.wercker.com/docs/getting-started/setup_app.html) of the
guide.
